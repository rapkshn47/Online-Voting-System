# Online-Voting-System
Its an online voting system where the admin can register the voters and the voters can vote for the party they are in favour of their party.
The admin can check the number of votes gained by each party and also can check the voters detail.
The voter who have already voted could not vote anymore and all the voters can vote only if they have a voterId.
